My uni task: linked list(stack) implementation

I loved this one, it was really interesting to do. Try it if you heard of pointers

## Implemented operations with list:
void add_el(int el_val)  
void insert(int el_val, int index) not replace, add new one  
void rem(int index)  
void replace_val(int old_val, int new_val) replace (match by value)  
bool is_empty()  
int top_i() get first(?) element  
void pop() remove first(?) element of list / pop stack  
void view() print all elements  
void clear() the whole list  


## How array vs list works
#### (idk, that's how i understand it. i'm noob, keep in mind when taking it as truth)

### array
When an array is created, the system searches for a contiguous block of memory that can fit all its elements. This is why you need to define the array size beforehandâ€” so the compiler can allocate enough space in one continuous block. 

### list
list doesnt need a sequence of free memory for its whole length. Instead, each element(node) is allocated separately. List element is a struct of value and adress(pointer) to the next element of list. nullptr is used to indicate the end of the list.
